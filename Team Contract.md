# Team Contract



## Team Members
- Braeden Giasson
- Sarim Syed
- Payal Rathod

## Strength & Weaknesses

### Strengths

- **Braeden**: My strengths include UI design/layout, formatting code with comments, and problem solving.
- **Sarim**: I am pretty strong with backend and also enjoy tinkering with the logic of the the program.
- **Payal**: My strengths include organization of code (separating code for each tasks and adding comments), UI design and debugging code to find the issue.

### Weaknesses

- **Braeden**: Depending on the size of the problem, I sometimes take a while to come up with a solution.
- **Sarim**: I get fixated on one thing and instead of moving onto something else I spend too much time on it.
- **Payal**: I'm sometimes slow when coding and have inconsistency in my code.


## Definition of “good enough” for this project

Our definition of good enough is being able to meet the requirements necessary to have a functional app, while also going above to challenge ourselves to do more to be proud of the last project we create in this program.

## Division of work

We decided to go with a primary and secondary approach, since each team member has their strengths and weaknesses, we wanted to have each team member focus primarily on their strengths, while also challenging us on our weaknesses to learn more.

- **Braeden**: I will focus primarily on the UI side of the app, while also working contributing to the connected objects parts of the project. 
- **Sarim**: I will focus primarily on the connected objects side of the project, while also contributing to the backend of the app.
- **Payal**: I will focus primarily on the backend of the app, while also contributing to the UI and connected objects side. 

## Frequency of communication

We will communicate through Discord as it's the easiest to receive notifications from, and we will communicate a minimum of 1-2 times a week outside of class time. Also, we agree that anytime we start working on or finish a task, to let the other team members know so that we stay up to date and are aware of each others paces.

## Response delays

A reasonable delay to reply to messages is 24 hours (weekends included) as this is enough time to make sure we're all staying on track for the sprint. However, if time is coming close to a deadline, the delay should be less than 7 hours to ensure we make the deadline.

## Receiving feedback

We all agree that we'd like to receive feedback in an honest constructive feedback way, getting straight to the point while also being respectful.

- **Braeden**: Hey Sarim, your code looks really good, I just noticed a couple of things that could be adjusted to work better. Let me know when you have time to discuss possible solutions?
- **Sarim**: Hey Payal, I'm having a bit of trouble following what your code is doing and I was wondering if you could write more comments so that it's easier to follow?
- **Payal**: Hey Braeden, your code seems to be good, but this button is crashing sometimes, maybe try doing it this way instead of what you did.

## In case of conflict

In the event of failed communication to reach out to a team member, we would have the other team members both reach out the team member not responding as much as possible to get a response. If time exceeds the delay time we set above, we will send a final message to the team member letting them know if they do not respond, we will have to inform a teacher of the situation.

In the event of a team member not responding well to constructive feedback, we address it by setting a meeting (home or school) to discuss the problem, and if  nothing is resolved, the other team members will reach out to a teacher for help on what to do in the situation.
